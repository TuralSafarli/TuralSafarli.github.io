            <p> The king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah), also known as the hamadryad, is a venomous snake species in the family Elapidae, endemic to forests from India through Southeast Asia. It is threatened by habitat destruction and has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 2010.It is the world's longest venomous snake.Adult king cobras are 3.18 to 4 m (10.4 to 13.1 ft) long. The longest known individual measured 5.85 m (19.2 ft).Despite the word "cobra" in its common name, this species does not belong to the genus Naja, the true cobras, but is the sole member of its own genus Ophiophagus. It preys chiefly on other snakes and occasionally on some other vertebrates, such as lizards and rodents. It is a highly venomous and dangerous snake when agitated or provoked that has a fearsome reputation in its range,although it is typically shy and avoids confrontation with humans when possible.The king cobra is a prominent symbol in the mythology and folk traditions of India, Sri Lanka and Myanmar.It is the national reptile of India.</p>
